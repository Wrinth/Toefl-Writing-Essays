# Younger school children (age five to ten) should be required to study art and music in addition to math, language, science, and history.

## Response:

In today’s society, there is too much emphasis on the core subjects of math, language, and science to the detriment of a wider and more balanced curriculum. Humanities and creative disciplines such as the arts and music, are marginalized and often fall by the wayside. In my opinion, the exploration of creativity through art and music is just as important for child’s development as the study of core subjects. Also, education is more than just mastering essential skills and knowledge.

Primarily, studying art and music encourages creative thinking amongst children. In art and music classes, unconventional thinking is encouraged so that students are able to come up with novel and interesting ideas. This is to say, students can be taught creative skills, and then be given free rein to express themselves. These sorts of activities build up imagination and intellectual curiosity, as well as encourage inventive thinking, which will help children to think outside the box and provide innovative solution to problems as adults.

Second, an arts education helps with the emotional development of a child. It will helps them to cope with the stresses of life and make them less vulnerable to depression and anxiety. Researchers are currently experimenting with art and music for therapeutic purpose; initial studies show that art therapy is very effective in addressing emotional and psychological issues. I know from personal experience that art can really help. When I was younger, I was lean and weak, which made me a prime target for the bullies in school. In art class, I drew myself as a superhero and this process of reimaging myself gave me the strength to cope with the bullying and eventually stand up for myself. Therefore, by providing non-threatening means for children to express their thought and feelings, art and music sooth their nerves and restore their souls.

Finally, a strong engagement with art and music will help children to develop an appreciation of the beauty around them, and this will make them more environmentally-conscious. That is not to say that a subject like math cannot contain beauty, but beauty is experienced much more frequently and directly in the arts. Stunning landscape painting, soul-stirring music and pictures in galleries are all example of beauty, which students can appreciate. Such experience will make children more likely to appreciate the beauty of a forest, habitat or woodland, or an alternative way of living and recognize the importance of protecting such things from destruction.

It is a disgrace that arts education doesn’t get the attention it deserves, because its benefits are both numerous and long lasting. It not only develops creativity, but provides people with an outlet to express their feeling, leading to healthier minds. The government would do well to incorporate more creative subjects such as art and music into the children’s education system.
