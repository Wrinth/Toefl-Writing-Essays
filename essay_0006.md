# Children should spend all their time on studying and playing, and they shouldn’t be required to help family with household chores, such as cooking, etc.

## Response:

Household chores such as helping with the cooking, doing the laundry, putting away groceries or doing shelves are supposed to be part of home life for children. Nonetheless, there are some parents who believe children should focus on study and recreation, and not concern themselves with such domestic tasks. I believe that such cossetting of children could be harmful for the reason discussed below.

No one can deny the significance of study and play to the development of children. Education lays down a foundation for children and equips them with skills and knowledge necessary for their future. They learn about basic scientific facts, but perhaps even more importantly, they begin to think, to judge, to criticize and to reason for themselves, skills required in daily life. Playing is also critical for children, as it has numerous benefits. Children develop their interpersonal skills and cultivate friendships through interaction with peers, Boys will emulate their heroes in films and engage in mock battles with friends, whilst girls will play house, enacting roles they may undertake as grown-ups. Such activities, teach children how to convince others, how to apologize after making a mistake, and how to lead and follow, all of which are important in adult life.

Undeniably, study and play are important to children, but so are household chores, as chores allow them to become more independent and responsible. If parents always do the chores, children will consider this the norm and expect that this is the duty of parents to serve them and satisfy whatever they want. This will make them lazy and irresponsible, thinking their only job is to study and their parents will attend to everything else. Such thinking could gradually develop into life-long dependence on parents. I behave well in kindergarten, so I deserve this toy and that doll; I gain an excellent GPA in high school and thus it is justified to demand this newly-released laptop and that latest cell phone; I graduate from university and therefore it is my parents’ duty to pay for the wedding and buy me a big house. This is not an exaggeration at all; there are many real-life instances where parents have been burdened with their children for life.

All things considered, it is necessary for children to help with simple domestic task every day as it helps their social and mental development.
