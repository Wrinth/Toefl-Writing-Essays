# All university students should be required to take history courses no matter what field they study in

Today, students study a wide range of subjects and disciplines in universities. However, history courses are in the decline, and they are routinely merged with other subjects. Traditionalists argue that young people know little of the history of their country or the evolution of human society and the subject should be compulsory for all students, regardless of their majors. I disagree with this view, as the proposition is problematic.

First and foremost, the compulsory study of history will put more pressure on students and eat into their precious time. College students already study theoretical and professional courses and their schedules are already very tight. For example, a medical student is obligated to complete academic study for credits, and acquire clinical experience. Students with such a heavy workload cannot afford to study irrelevant courses, such as history. This would unnecessarily burden students and jeopardize studies, exacerbating their worries about meeting multiple deadlines and passing final exams.

Second, the requirement to study history leads to unnecessary cost for parents and students. University will need to recruit personnel, including administrative staff and lecturers to deliver the lectures and tutorials, which will increase the cost of schooling. These costs will be passed onto the student and will be reflected in higher tuition fees, depriving many underprivileged students of an opportunity to attend university.

Admittedly, studying history is beneficial for young people. Students will gain an understanding of how society evolved and learn not to repeat mistakes made in the past. For instance, students would learn about the causes of two World Wars and other bloody battles that claimed the lives of millions and changed the course of history. Also, students could gain a better understanding of current issues by studying historical events. For example, by studying the American Revolution, a student can be enlightened on the concept of democracy and its application to the model world. However, historical knowledge can be gain be method other than compulsory courses. In this day and age, television programs, films, documentaries, books, and museums are all available options for students to learn about history.

In conclusion, although there are few benefits to studying history, it would be unfair to burden a student both academically and financially. In addition, the benefits a history course would provide can be obtained through other means.
