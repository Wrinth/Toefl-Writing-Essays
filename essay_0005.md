# Students should spend a year to travel or to work before they go to college or university.

## Response:

Nowadays, taking a gap year has almost become a right of passage for many high school graduates, especially in western countries. During this time, students backpack around the world armed with a copy of the lonely Planet, work or combine work and travel. There is much debate on whether a gap year is a waste of time for students or an enriching experience which will broaden their horizons. I support the idea of a gap year, as it is a good way to prepare students for the rigours of university life.

Firstly, a gap year will help students to recover from the monotony of continuous study and allow them to refresh their minds. A gap year gives students a much-deserved break before they embark on the next stage of their life. During this break, students can learn new languages, travel, or undertake community service or work. By providing them with an opportunity to interact with different people and learn about different cultures, these activities will rejuvenate themselves both mentally and physically.

Secondly, taking a break from education and going away from a while gives students the opportunity to learn about themselves and really consider what courses they want to study. During the period from elementary to high schools, most students are focused on securing good marks and decision relating to their education are made by parents. Unsurprisingly, some students never had the opportunity to think independently and consider their own feelings. If students are given their chance to take a gap year, they are more likely to discover their true calling in life. I read in a newspaper that an American high school graduate spent a gap year looking after orphaned children, which led him to study public affairs management at university, as such experiences gave him a strong sense of mission towards the disadvantaged.

Admittedly, taking a gap year before university can have disadvantages. Some young people may waste the year lazing around and playing, which contribute little to their personal development. In fact, some students may find it difficult to settle back into education on their return. However, with the help of their universities and parents, students will be able to manage their time wisely and settle sown to student life again.

I believe without a doubt, that a gap year is a very worthwhile experience for high school graduates. It refreshes the mind of young people before university and enables them to make better personal choices, which are crucial for students to succeed in study and life.
